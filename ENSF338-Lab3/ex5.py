#Question 4
# The Binary Insertion sort and the traditional insertion sort algorithms are both the same complexity of O(n^2). 
# However, despite this the binary insertion sort performs faster at greater array sizes. 
# This occurs due to the faster algorithmic advantage Binary Insertion sort has in comparisons. 
# It can search and find the value much more efficiently thanks to its use of binary search opposed to insertion sortâ€™s linear search. 
# However, this does not change its complexity as it still needs to complete the same number of swaps, 
# the only benefit is its ability to find the value that must be swapped (or need to swap) faster.
